Controls are simple and as follows:

Left mouse button = places selected cell type;
Right mouse button = erases cells (places empty);
Middle mouse button = pans the camera around;
Scroll wheel = zooms (although is not the best zoom, as it only resizes the render texture);
Left shift + scroll wheel = increases/decreases brush size;
1, 2 and 3 = respectively change the cell type to sand, brick and water;

Thats it, now have fun!
